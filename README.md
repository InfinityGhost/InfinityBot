# InfinityBot

This is a bot with a UI built by me, for my own discords. It's a huge mess of code, I know.
It is generally focused on server management, but there's some fun stuff too.

# Notes

* UI can be run completely seperately from the bot
* Current functions:
	* Permission-based commands
		* Basic user commands
		* Moderation and cleanup
	* Messages & commands can sent through UI
	* Active logging

# Planned features

* Music bot
