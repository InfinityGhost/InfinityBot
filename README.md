# InfinityBot
This is a bot with a UI built by me, for my own discords. It's a huge mess of code, I know.
It is generally focused on server management, but there's some added fun stuff too.

## Functions
* UI can be run completely seperately from the bot
* Current functions:
	* Permission-based commands
		* Basic user commands
		* Moderation and cleanup
	* Messages & commands can sent through UI
	* Active logging

## Built with
* [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net/) by [RogueException](https://github.com/RogueException)

## Todo list
* Add music functionality with Lavalink
